# php-shop

This repository contains a web application for an online store, implemented using HTML, CSS, PHP, and following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, as well as an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach.

## Technologies and Details

- **HTML**: The web application is constructed using HTML to create the page structure and user interface.

- **CSS**: CSS is used for styling and design to make our store visually appealing.

- **PHP**: We utilize PHP for server-side logic, including database interactions, order processing, and user interaction.

- **MVC**: The project is structured according to the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, which separates the application's logic, presentation, and data for ease of development and maintenance.

- **OOP**: We employ an object-oriented approach to create models, controllers, and other components, simplifying the application's structure and extensibility.

## Key Features

- Browse and search for products in the online store.
- Add products to the shopping cart and proceed with order checkout.
- Administrator capabilities: add, remove, and edit products.
